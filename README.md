### Hey!

I'm James. I'm a software engineer who mostly specialises in .NET and C# with my professional experience being backend.

Most of my activity here is focused on [osu!](https://github.com/ppy)(stable) and managing osu! pp related things nowadays. I occasionally write at my [blog](https://blog.tsunyoku.xyz/) too.
